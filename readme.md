An R package for miscellaneous small tasks 
including filesystem operations 
(e.g., batch file rename, bash editing text files, displaying files with specific extension, etc),
string manipulation, 
history command manipulation and (batch) variable transforms.
These utilities make using R more convenient and fun.
